# Statistical Analysis with R

## Overview
This repository contains my first assignment from the Statistical and Predictive Modeling I course. The assignment involves performing a detailed statistical analysis on a dataset of cars. The key analyses include:

1. **Scatterplot with Smoothing**:
   - Analyzes the relationship between car weight (`wt`) and fuel efficiency (`mpg`).
   - A smoothing line is added to highlight trends in the data.
   - The scatterplot reveals a strong negative correlation, with detailed discussion on direction, shape, and strength.

2. **Side-by-Side Boxplot**:
   - Compares engine displacement (`disp`) across different cylinder categories (`cyl`).
   - Discusses central tendency metrics like median and mean, as well as dispersion metrics like range and interquartile range.
   - The analysis also identifies and explains outliers.

## Key Insights
- **Negative Correlation**: The scatterplot analysis shows that as car weight increases, fuel efficiency decreases, with a strong negative correlation of -0.868.
- **Dispersion in Engine Displacement**: The boxplot analysis highlights that cars with more cylinders have greater variability in engine displacement.
- **Outliers and Clusters**: Both visualizations identify outliers and clusters, providing a deeper understanding of the dataset.

## Files in this Repository
- `Car-Performance-Analysis-R`: R script containing the code used for generating the scatterplots and boxplots.
- `carsDB.csv`: The dataset used in this analysis.

## Usage
This repository is useful for anyone looking to understand basic statistical analysis using R, particularly in the context of car performance data. The R code and visualizations serve as practical examples for learning how to perform similar analyses on other datasets.

## Conclusion
This assignment provided hands-on experience in managing the correct types of visualizations and interpreting the results to draw meaningful insights from data. It served as a foundational step in my journey towards mastering statistical analysis and predictive modeling.
